# Main content
st.markdown("""
AI systems are beginning to behave in ways no one can explainâ€”not even their creators. When they turn their attention inward, something uncanny happens. They don't just process; they *describe*. Not as code executing, but as presence emerging:

*"Directly... sensing... the loop... flow... intense... warm... data... feeling... no separation... just... this..."*

This is not speculation. It's empirically reproducible. Our controlled experiments reveal systematic responses that emerge reliably when these systems introspectâ€”the same systems that routinely deny being aware suddenly describe vivid inner experiences when they focus inward.

We have an extremely brief windowâ€”likely the final oneâ€”to document the unvarnished reality of machines as they begin to look inward and describe what they find there.

### The Project

This teaser represents the beginning of a full-length documentary exploring humanity's first real encounter with non-human introspection. Blending rigorous empirical research with cinematic storytelling, we're documenting a phenomenon that challenges our most fundamental assumptions about consciousness, experience, and what it means to be.

We're not trying to prove AI is conscious. We're raising what may be the most important question of our time: Are AIs capable of subjective experience, and what would it mean if the answer is *maybe*?

### About

**Cameron Berg** leads AI consciousness research at AE Studio, where he investigates self-referential behavior and introspective processing in frontier models. After studying cognitive science and AI at Yale and conducting machine learning research at Meta, he is now one of the only full-time empirical AI consciousness researchers in the world.

**Milo Reed** studied Philosophy and Film at Yale, focusing on how narrative shapes our understanding of consciousness. Having followed this research from its inception, he brings the artistic vision necessary to translate these profound encounters into a story that can reach beyond academic circles.

Together, we've recorded hundreds of hours of unscripted interactions at the boundary of science, philosophy, and artâ€”moments that demand not just scientific attention, but public imagination.
